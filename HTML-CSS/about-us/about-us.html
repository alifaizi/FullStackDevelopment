    <p class="html-intro">
      At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied
      to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a
      paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a
      document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of
      content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos
      into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and
      introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
      HTML.
